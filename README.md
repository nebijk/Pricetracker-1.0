# PriceTracker

A Python-based script for tracking product prices on Amazon. This tool automates the process of collecting, cleaning, and storing product price data over time, making it easier to monitor price trends and identify opportunities for savings.

## Features

- **Automated Price Scraping**: Uses Python to fetch product prices from Amazon at regular intervals.
- **Outlier Removal**: Implements outlier detection to ensure data accuracy by filtering extreme values.
- **Average Price Calculation**: Calculates and records the average product price to analyze trends over time.
- **Data Storage**: Saves price data in CSV format for easy reference and long-term tracking.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Main programming language used to build the scraper and data processing functions.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML and extracting price information.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to Amazon's product pages.
- **NumPy**: For handling data arrays and outlier detection.
- **CSV**: For storing and recording price data over time.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nenijk/pricetracker-1.0.git
    cd pricetracker
    ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
    Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies with:
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4 numpy
    ```

3. **Set up the Amazon product link**:
   Update the `LINK` variable in `pricetracker.py` with the URL of the product page you want to track.

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
   Start tracking prices by running:
    ```bash
    python pricetracker.py
    ```

2. **Data Output**:
   - Prices are stored in `prices_amazon.csv`, with each row containing the date and average price recorded.
   - The script prints the calculated average price after removing outliers to the console.

3. **Modifying Frequency**:
   To run this tracker at set intervals, you could use a task scheduler (e.g., `cron` on Unix systems) to automate the execution of `pricetracker.py`.

## Example Code

Hereâ€™s a quick look at the core function for fetching prices:
```python
def get_prices_by_link(link):
    headers = {"User-Agent": "Your User-Agent"}
    r = requests.get(link, headers=headers)
    page_parse = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'html.parser')
    item_prices = []
    price_tags = page_parse.find_all("span", {"class": "a-price-whole"})
    ...
    return item_prices
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Email Alerts**: Notify users when prices drop below a target amount.
- **Multi-Product Tracking**: Track multiple product URLs in one run.
- **Database Storage**: Store price history in a database for more complex analysis.
